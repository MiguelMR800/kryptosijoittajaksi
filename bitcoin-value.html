  <h1>Why Does Bitcoin Have Value ‚Äì and Where Does It Come From?</h1>

  <p>Bitcoin is not a company, and there‚Äôs no central bank or government behind it. Yet it has value ‚Äì and many people are willing to pay thousands of euros for it. Why?</p>
  <p>Bitcoin's value comes from a combination of scarcity, decentralized technology, and community trust. New bitcoins are created at a predetermined rate, and the total supply is limited to 21 million. This makes it a rare exception in the digital world: a truly limited resource.</p>
  <p>In addition, Bitcoin operates without any central authority. It‚Äôs an open and transparent system where anyone can verify transactions on the blockchain. It cannot be manipulated, frozen, or shut down.</p>
  <p>So its value doesn‚Äôt come from someone just ‚Äúsaying it‚Äôs valuable,‚Äù but from the real, practical features Bitcoin offers: a secure and censorship-resistant way to store and transfer value digitally.</p>

  <h2>Also Available in Finland</h2>
  <p>Finland also has trusted local crypto service providers such as
    <a href="https://app.coinmotion.com/fi/register/signup?referral_code=DAWL3TJGXHKJPUK9KPWP">Coinmotion</a>,
    <a href="https://app.northcrypto.com/en/signup?refCode=41973gv89">Northcrypto</a>, and
    <a href="https://kvarnx.com/rekisteroityminen/UUYYY7M90V">Kvarn X</a>.
    These are not included in the comparison table because they focus more on brokerage services and operate on a smaller scale than global platforms.
  </p>
  <p>However, they are fully regulated and trusted in Finland ‚Äì making them an excellent choice especially for beginners who appreciate local support and simple onboarding.</p>
