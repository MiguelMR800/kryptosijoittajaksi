  <h1>Why Does Bitcoin Have Value ‚Äì and Where Does It Come From?</h1>

  <p>
    Bitcoin is not a company, and there‚Äôs no central bank or government behind it. Yet it has value ‚Äì and many people are willing to pay thousands of euros for it. Why?
  </p>

  <p>
    Bitcoin's value comes from a combination of scarcity, decentralized technology, and community trust. New bitcoins are created at a predetermined rate, and the total supply is limited to 21 million. This makes it a rare exception in the digital world: a truly limited resource.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, Bitcoin operates without any central authority. It‚Äôs an open and transparent system where anyone can verify transactions on the blockchain. It cannot be manipulated, frozen, or shut down.
  </p>

  <p>
    So its value doesn‚Äôt come from someone just ‚Äúsaying it‚Äôs valuable,‚Äù but from the real, practical features Bitcoin offers: a secure and censorship-resistant way to store and transfer value digitally.
  </p>

  <h2>Affiliate Tip</h2>

  <p>
    If you want to buy Bitcoin safely and easily, here are the platforms I personally use:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.binance.com/referral/mystery-box/2025-pizza-day/claim?ref=GRO_16987_2EVA3" target="_blank">Binance ‚Üí</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://partner.bybit.com/b/migu" target="_blank">Bybit ‚Üí</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.mexc.com/register?inviteCode=1NqUe" target="_blank">MEXC ‚Üí</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Finland also has trusted local crypto service providers such as
    <a href="https://app.coinmotion.com/fi/register/signup?referral_code=DAWL3TJGXHKJPUK9KPWP" target="_blank">Coinmotion</a>,
    <a href="https://app.northcrypto.com/en/signup?refCode=41973gv89" target="_blank">Northcrypto</a>,
    and <a href="https://kvarnx.com/rekisteroityminen/UUYYY7M90V" target="_blank">Kvarn X</a>.
    These are not included in the international comparison because they focus more on brokerage services and operate on a smaller scale than global platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, they are well-regulated and trusted in Finland ‚Äì making them a safe and simple option especially for beginners who prefer local support and services in English.
