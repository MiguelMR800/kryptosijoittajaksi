    <h1>Trading Styles and Chart Patterns – Types, Signals and Probabilities</h1>

    <h2>Trading Styles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scalping</strong> – Very short-term trading (seconds to minutes). Targets tiny price movements, often repeated dozens of times per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Day trading</strong> – Positions opened and closed within the same day. No overnight holdings.</li>
        <li><strong>Swing trading</strong> – Trades held for days or weeks. Based on a mix of technical and fundamental analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Position trading</strong> – Long-term speculative trading, positions can last for months. Based on macro trends and cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Chart Patterns</h2>
    <p>Chart patterns are recurring formations in price action that may indicate the next likely move. Below are popular examples and their historical success rates:</p>

    <h3>1. Head & Shoulders</h3>
    <p>Signals a trend reversal. Three peaks with the middle being the highest. Success rate: ~80–85% for trend change.</p>

    <h3>2. Inverted Head & Shoulders</h3>
    <p>Bullish reversal after a downtrend. Three bottoms with the middle being the lowest. Success rate: ~80–85% upward breakout.</p>

    <h3>3. Double Top / Double Bottom</h3>
    <p>Double top signals resistance; double bottom signals support. Powerful reversal patterns. Success rate: ~75–80% reversal.</p>

    <h3>4. Symmetrical Triangle</h3>
    <p>Price consolidates in a tightening range. Neutral pattern, but often leads to strong breakout. Breakout probability: 60–70%.</p>

    <h3>5. Ascending / Descending Triangle</h3>
    <p><strong>Ascending:</strong> horizontal resistance, rising lows – usually bullish.<br>
       <strong>Descending:</strong> horizontal support, falling highs – usually bearish.<br>
       Breakout probability: 70–75% in expected direction.</p>

    <h3>6. Rectangle</h3>
    <p>Sideways price movement between two horizontal levels. Indicates consolidation. Breakout probability: ~65%.</p>

    <h3>7. Ascending / Descending Channels</h3>
    <p>Sloped trend channels indicating rising or falling markets. A break outside the channel may signal trend continuation or reversal.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Technical analysis isn’t magic, but helps identify probability-based setups. Always combine patterns with indicators like volume or RSI, and never forget risk management!</p>
