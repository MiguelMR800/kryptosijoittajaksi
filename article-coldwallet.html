    <h1>Cold Wallet Usage – Benefits and Risks You Should Know</h1>

    <p>Cold wallets are physical or offline storage solutions used to keep your cryptocurrencies safe. Unlike hot wallets, they are not connected to the internet, significantly reducing the risk of hacks and theft.</p>

    <h2>What is a Cold Wallet?</h2>
    <p>A cold wallet is typically a hardware device or a paper wallet that stores private keys offline. Popular examples include Ledger and Trezor devices. When you hold crypto in a cold wallet, it means your funds are safe from online threats—but it also means you must be careful not to lose the device or its recovery seed.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Cold Wallets</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maximum security – private keys remain offline</li>
        <li>Ideal for long-term storage (HODLing)</li>
        <li>Immune to most malware and phishing attacks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks and Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must back up and securely store the recovery seed</li>
        <li>Risk of losing the device or forgetting PIN</li>
        <li>Not as convenient for regular trading or quick access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Before You Transfer Your Funds</h2>
    <p>Test small transactions first. Make sure the device is genuine and obtained from an official source. Learn how to send, receive, and confirm transactions using your cold wallet.</p>
