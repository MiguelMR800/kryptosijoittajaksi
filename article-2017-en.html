    <h1>My First Crypto Bull Run – How Bitcoin Changed Everything</h1>

    <p>I entered the crypto world in 2017, right in the middle of the historic bull run. Prices were climbing almost daily, and the hype was unreal. Everyone was talking about Bitcoin, ICOs, and getting rich quickly.</p>

    <p>At first, it was exciting. Then came the reality: extreme volatility, confusing technology, and a flood of misinformation. But that wild ride was also the beginning of something bigger.</p>

    <p>I began to understand the fundamentals of blockchain. Bitcoin wasn’t just digital money – it was a decentralized system, built on cryptographic trust. Over time, I started learning about Ethereum, smart contracts, and what makes different cryptocurrencies valuable.</p>

    <p>The crash of early 2018 taught me about risk and emotions. But what impressed me most was how Bitcoin survived. No hacks. No downtime. It just kept producing block after block, proving its resilience.</p>

    <p>Since then, I’ve stayed in the space. Every new cycle brings new technologies, new narratives, and new opportunities. But that first bull run in 2017 – that changed how I look at value, finance, and independence forever.</p>
